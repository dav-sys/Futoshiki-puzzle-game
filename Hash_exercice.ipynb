        "\n",
        "This challenge was designed to test your creativity in an unconventional scenario. There are three lists with varying levels of difficulty, `hashes_easy`, `hashes_medium`, and `hashes_hard`. \n",
        "Your job is to find out, or approximate as best as you can the hidden hash function. These functions are purely made of a combination of binary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a hash function:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def hash_function_test(x):\n",
        "  return x & 2\n",
        "\n",
        "# you only get the `hashes_test`\n",
        "hashes_test = [hash_function_test(x) for x in range(2048)]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Solution's format\n",
        "You can use any amount of precomputation you want.\n",
        "However, the solution must be thought of as entirely standalone. Any resources you use, whether that be helper functions, vectors of coefficients, or anything else must be included in the function's scope\n",
        "\n",
        "e.g.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def solution(x):\n",
        "  # some_utility must be defined inside the solution function\n",
        "  def some_utility(y):\n",
        "    return y*2\n",
        "  \n",
        "  # same for constants\n",
        "  coefficients = [1,2,3,4]\n",
        "  \n",
        "  return some_utility(x) * coefficients[x%4]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You can only assume that `numpy` is imported (as `np`), however you can install arbitrary packages using \n",
        "`!pip install package` and use them for your precomputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scoring\n",
        "Your score is based on the __length__ (in characters!) of the solution you provide, together with the proximity to the ground truth. Special characters are not counted (newlines, spaces, tabs, general symbols), and the first 100 characters are also not counted. To see the exact definition of the score, check the code of the `evaluate` function. **Please document your approach** as it will strongly be considered in our evaluation, even if it doesn't score very well.\n",
